NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckExtraTests - check xt tests before release

VERSION
    version 0.022

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

      [CheckExtraTests]

DESCRIPTION
    Runs all xt tests before release. Dies if any fail. Sets RELEASE_TESTING
    and AUTHOR_TESTING.

    If you use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TestRelease, you should consider using
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RunExtraTests instead, which enables xt tests to
    run as part of "[TestRelease]" and is thus a bit more efficient as the
    distribution is only built once for testing.

ATTRIBUTES
  default_jobs
    This attribute is the default value that should be used as the "jobs"
    argument for prerelease tests.
