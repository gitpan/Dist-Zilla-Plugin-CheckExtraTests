=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckExtraTests - check xt tests before release

=head1 VERSION

version 0.022

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your dist.ini:

  [CheckExtraTests]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Runs all xt tests before release.  Dies if any fail.  Sets RELEASE_TESTING
and AUTHOR_TESTING.

If you use L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TestRelease>, you should consider using
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RunExtraTests> instead, which enables xt tests to
run as part of C<[TestRelease]> and is thus a bit more efficient as the
distribution is only built once for testing.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 default_jobs

This attribute is the default value that should be used as the C<jobs> argument
for prerelease tests.
